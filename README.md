# GraphQL-voyager-starter

This project provides a simple addition for a spring-boot application that adds the graphql-voyager application
at URL /voyager.  This assumes the project using the component is a standard GraphQL spring-boot server, *i.e.* that
the actual graphql component is at URL /graphql.
